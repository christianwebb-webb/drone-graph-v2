"""models/*.sysml -> a knowledge graph on GraphRAG's workbench, in out/kg.

This is graphrag_importer's own extraction pipeline, run in-process. It reads the
source text, asks an LLM for the entities and the relations between them, clusters
the result with Leiden and writes one report per cluster. Nothing here parses
SysML.

Two things tell it what it is reading. The ontology, which is not written out here:
`config.kinds()` and `config.relation_types()` return whatever the parser and the
resolver actually recognise (56 kinds and 47 relations as it stands), so the list
the model is given cannot drift from the list Layer 2 uses. They go over as
`entity_types` and `relationship_types` with `enable_strict_types=True`, which makes
them a closed vocabulary rather than a suggestion: an entity or edge whose type is
not on the list is dropped, not renamed. And the prompts in `prompts`, which
replace two of upstream's; the
defaults are written for narrative prose and that module says what went wrong when
they were pointed at a declaration.

Provenance survives, which is the part worth knowing. `ainsert` takes a
`metadata_list` alongside the texts and merges each dict into that document's
record; `import_documents` reads `name`, `citable_url` and `file_id` back out of
it (graphrag/importer/import_graph_to_adb.py:1783). Chunks carry `full_doc_id` and
entities carry the chunk ids they were found in, so every entity traces back to
the files it came from through the graph the importer already builds.

    """The extraction pipeline, configured and pointed at one model's workbench.

    `enable_chunk_embeddings` is on because the `unified` retriever searches the
    source chunks in parallel with the entity graph, and without vectors on the
    chunks that half of it has nothing to search.

    A workbench per model is what keeps entity names from merging across two
    unrelated vehicles -- the merge happens here, in the builder's own graph, long
    before ArangoDB sees anything, so it is the only place it can be scoped.

    The LLM cache lives in the working directory, so a second run over unchanged
    files re-reads the answers instead of re-buying them. It is keyed on the whole
    prompt (`_llm.py:71`), so changing anything in `prompts` invalidates it and the
    next run pays for the answers again.

    `entity_extract_max_gleaning=0` switches off the second pass over each chunk.
    It sends "MANY entities were missed in the last extraction ... look for
    entities you may have overlooked, especially less common entity types" with no
    way to answer that none were, which is a fair nudge on prose and an instruction
    to invent on a file whose declarations were all found the first time. It is
    also two thirds of the LLM calls: three per chunk become one.
