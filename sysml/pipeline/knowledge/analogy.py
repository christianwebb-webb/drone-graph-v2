"""Cross-model analogy edges, found by autograph's own SimilarityFinder.

Extraction relates elements a file talks about. It cannot relate two vehicles to
each other, because no Apollo file mentions a drone -- so nothing in the graph
crosses a model boundary except where the two happen to use the same word for the
same thing. Everything shares one embedding space, which is enough for a `unified`
question to pull both models into one answer, but there is nothing to query and
nothing to rank: "what plays the drone battery's role in Apollo?" has no path to
walk.

autograph already solves "which of these resemble each other" in
`corpus_graph.similarity_finding.SimilarityFinder`: semantic search and BM25 over
the same corpus, fused with reciprocal rank, top_k kept. That class runs here
unmodified, against the local container.

Two things are arranged around it rather than changed inside it.

**Granularity.** autograph's corpus layer compares whole documents, and reads only
the first `CorpusGraphConfig.CHUNK_MAX_CHARS` of each. So the corpus handed to it
is one document per *entity*, not per file -- every entity is far inside the
truncation bound, and the edges land where the question is. The descriptions and
the vectors are the ones extraction already wrote, so this step buys no embeddings.

**Direction.** `SimilarityFinder` restricts candidates with `module_doc_ids`,
which it applies before fusion so a foreign document cannot consume the top_k
window -- its purpose upstream is to keep edges *inside* a module. The same
argument runs backwards: pass the entities of the *other* models and the only
edges it can build are the ones that cross.

Entities are compared only against their own `entity_type` -- a part against a
part, a requirement against a requirement. Without that gate the nearest neighbour
of a part is regularly a requirement that talks about the part, which is a topical
match and not an analogy.
