"""Two ways to ask the graph a question in English. Both are stock read paths.

`aqlizer(question)` -- Arango's natural-language-to-AQL service, the `txt2aql`
package from natural-language-service, imported unmodified. It inspects the
collections, writes AQL, runs it and explains the rows. The only thing this project
gives it is `aql_examples`, read from `aql_examples.md` -- the argument
`ReadOnlyArangoGraphQAChain.from_llm` has always accepted and the deployed service
never passes. No query is written here: if an answer is wrong the fix goes in that
file. `provenance_gap` is the one exception and does not write AQL either -- it reads
the query that came back and, on the one mistake that leaves a query running cleanly
and counting the wrong set, sends the question round again with the fault named.
`instance(path)` runs the whole thing on a different examples file, which is how
the generated one gets compared against the hand-written one.

`graphrag(question)` -- the GraphRAG retriever service from graphrag_retrievers,
run in-process against the local database. `local` is hybrid vector + BM25 search
over the entities fused with reciprocal rank, then expanded over the relations;
`global` answers from the community reports; `unified` searches the source text and
the entity graph in parallel. All three come back with citations that resolve to a
source file. This is the path for descriptive and whole-model
questions; AQLizer handles analytical ones.

Every AQLizer answer carries the AQL that produced it, because a generated query
that is subtly wrong returns no rows, and a fluent sentence over no rows is
indistinguishable from a correct answer about something genuinely absent.

    python -m sysml.nl "which requirements does nothing satisfy?"
    python -m sysml.nl --graphrag "what does the drone battery do?"
    python -m sysml.nl --graphrag --scope global "what does this model cover?"

# Two faults a generated query can have that leave it running cleanly and
# answering the wrong question. Both are read off the query itself, because a
# query has a shape that can be checked and the English that produced it does not.
#
# The first is asking Layer 3 something Layer 2 knows. `sysml_Entities` is a
# language model's reading of the sources; it has no values and no declared
# structure, so counting or summing over it answers a question about what the
# extraction happened to name rather than about what the files declare. The examples
# file says so, and it is long -- prose in a long document does not carry, and the
# same run that copied an example query verbatim ignored the paragraph beside it.
# Naming the fault in a second request is the one form of instruction a model
# cannot skim past, and unlike wording it can be tested.
#
# The second is a bind parameter. The chain executes what it wrote with no bind
# values, so `@name` is a query that cannot run at all.
#
# The third is scoping members by a substring of `display`. "For each stage of the
# Saturn V" gets written as `CONTAINS(e.display, "SATURNV")`, which finds the
# subject and anything named after it and misses every member with a name of its
# own -- which is most of them, since a well-named part is not named after its
# parent. It cannot be caught by wording in the examples file: the file says not to
# and shows the walk instead, and the phrasing of the question pulls hard enough
# that the substring still gets written. It also cannot be caught by the result,
# because it returns rows. The shape is the only signal, and the shape is precise:
# a substring match on `display` against a quoted literal, with no traversal
# anywhere in the query.

class Retriever:
    """graphrag_retrievers' RetrievalService, pointed at the local database.

    `local` is entity-centred: hybrid vector + BM25 search over the entities,
    fused with reciprocal rank, then expanded over the relations touching what it
    found. `global` answers from the community reports, which is what a question
    about the model as a whole needs. `unified` searches the chunks of source text
    and the entity graph in parallel and answers from both -- `local` reaches a
    chunk only through an entity that matched first, so a fact written in a `doc`
    comment that no element name resembles is out of its reach.

    The service normally runs as a pod beside the platform, so three of the things
    it reaches for at startup are supplied here instead: a JWT, a service-status
    sink, and a token validator. Everything below those is the service's own code.
